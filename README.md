### Prerequisites

- **GoLang**: Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. Download it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cli-todo-app.git

    ```bash
    go build -o todo
    ```

3. **Move to Your PATH**

    ```bash
    mv todo /usr/local/bin/
    ```

    _Alternatively, you can use Go's install command:_

    ```bash
    go install
    ```

    Ensure that your `$GOPATH/bin` is added to your system's `PATH` to use the `todo` command globally.

```bash
todo --done <id>
```

### List All Todos
